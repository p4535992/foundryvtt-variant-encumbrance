A visual modification to player character sheets to better display the effects of the [Encumbrance variant ruleset in the PHB](https://5thsrd.org/rules/abilities/strength/).

- The rules for Lifting and Carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of Equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table.
- If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are encumbered, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.
- If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying Capacity, you are instead heavily encumbered, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on Ability Checks, Attack rolls, and Saving Throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.


The effects of this module are currently purely visual, although restricting movement and applying the negative effects of encumbrance are applied with the new active effect mechanism.

For D&D5e 1.4.2 and newer the system supports a core implementation of this encumbrance rule. The module should be synchronized with the core functionality, but this module will permit more customised rules for your weight calculations/thresholds and the speed penalties are integrated with active effect.

## Installation

It's always easiest to install modules from the in game add-on browser.

To install this module manually:

1.  Inside the Foundry "Configuration and Setup" screen, click "Add-on Modules"
2.  Click "Install Module"
3.  In the "Manifest URL" field, paste the following url:

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p4535992/foundryvtt-variant-encumbrance-dnd5e/master/src/module.json`

4.  Click 'Install' and wait for installation to complete
5.  Don't forget to enable the module in game using the "Manage Module" button

### libWrapper

This module uses the [libWrapper](https://github.com/ruipin/fvtt-lib-wrapper) library for wrapping core methods. It is a hard dependency and it is recommended for the best experience and compatibility with other modules.

### socketLib

This module uses the [socketLib](https://github.com/manuelVo/foundryvtt-socketlib) library for wrapping core methods. It is a hard dependency and it is recommended for the best experience and compatibility with other modules.

### midi-qol

This module uses the [midi-qol](https://gitlab.com/tposney/midi-qol/-/tree/master). It is a optional dependency but it is recommended for the best experience and compatibility with other modules.

**NOTE: If "midiqol" is deactivated or not present, the active effects will apply only the speed reduction without the variations of advantage and disadvantage typical of the rule**

## Known Issue

- Due to the million variations of the various use cases that I have to take into account the most attentive players may notice a slowdown which is logical if you think I have to redo the checks and refresh the flags every time it is inserted, updated, deleted, revised , edited an object with weight. You need someone more Expert than me to handle this, but i still think to have done a good job with the handling of the use cases.
- Limitation on some character sheet, open a issue and i'll try to make a fix.
- Is not full synchronized with DAE in favor of the standard active effects mechanism. but you can still use dae on the active effect.
- I have not found the time to fully test for the vehicle sheet so any feedback is more than welcome, seem to work anyway

## Compatibility

### Character Sheets Compatibility

* D&D5e Default Character Sheet
* [Sky's Alternate 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons Sheet](https://github.com/Sky-Captain-13/foundry/tree/master/alt5e) Seem to work
* [Tidy5e Sheet (Both light & dark themes)](https://github.com/sdenec/tidy5e-sheet) Seem to work
* [Compact DnDBeyond-like 5e Character Sheet](https://github.com/ElfFriend-DnD/foundryvtt-compactBeyond5eSheet) Active effect work, but there is no visual bar , the values of the weight are synchronized with the system core
* [DNDBeyond Character Sheet for 5E](https://github.com/jopeek/fvtt-dndbeyond-character-sheet) Active effect work, but there is no visual bar , the values of the weight are synchronized with the system core

### Other Modules Compatibility

* [Inventory +](https://github.com/p4535992/inventory-plus)
* [Dynamic Active Effects](https://gitlab.com/tposney/dae)
* [DFreds Convenient Effects](https://github.com/DFreds/dfreds-convenient-effects/)
* [Item Collection/Item Containers](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/itemcollection)
* [DragonFlagon Quality of Life, Vehicle Cargo Capacity Unit Feature](https://github.com/flamewave000/dragonflagon-fvtt/blob/master/df-qol/README.md#vehicle-cargo-capacity-unit)
* [Backpack Manager](https://github.com/krbz999/backpack-manager)

**I highly recommend avoiding module [Inventory +](https://github.com/p4535992/inventory-plus) in favor of the module [Item Collection/Item Containers](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/itemcollection)**

## Features

### Redesigned weight bar

![green](./wiki/green.png)
![orange](./wiki/orange.png)
![red](./wiki/red.png)
![yellowblack](./wiki/yellowblack.png)

The default character weight bar has received a lick of paint, giving labels for all four weight thresholds. These thresholds are also reconfigurable in the settings, and will update the bar to display the new proportions.

#### Effect-based Speed Reduction with Active Effects

![ae](./wiki/ae.png)

![ae2](./wiki/ae2.png)

Your encumbrance status is automatically used to provide a modified speed value, taking your default character speed and modifying it by -10 and -20 for encumbered and heavily encumbered, and reducing to 0 when over encumbered. (For 0.1.5, the speed value must be separated by a space from its units).

### Character Size & Powerful Build (Optional)

_Powerful Build Feature: You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift._

Enabled by default, the module will modify your maximum carry weight according to your character's size, and whether you have the powerful build special trait. This feature can be disabled in the module settings. (Credit to [Eruestani](https://github.com/Eruestani) for implementing this).

### Item Weight Multipliers (Optional)

In the module settings, custom multipliers are available for unequipped, equipped, and proficiently equipped items. This was mainly added for my house rules, where equipped proficient items get a small weight reduction due to experience handling them, but this lends some flexibility to the system for anyone to use.

### Buttons header sheet for enable/disable the features of Variant Encumbrance (Weight Calculation and Active Effects) actor by actor

Add new buttons on the header sheet of the actors for choose when to avoid to add the Active Effect or weight calculation. To much bad feed back on the automatization of the AE, i hope  with this to help the community to find the best solution for the single individual

| Symbol Button Header Sheet  | Description  |
|:----:|:----:|
|![weight-hanging-solid](./wiki/icons/weight-hanging-solid.svg) | If you want to have the Varian Encumbrance Active Effects and Weight calculation features on your actor make sure to have the "weight" symbol on the header sheet (this is the default) |
|![balance-scale-right-solid](./wiki/icons/balance-scale-right-solid.svg)| If you don't  want to have the Varian Encumbrance Active Effects feature on your actor make sure to have the "balance" symbol on the header sheet. ATTENTION the weight calculation feature is still active|
|![feather-solid](./wiki/icons/feather-solid.svg)| If you don't  want to have the Variant Encumbrance Active Effects and Weight calculation features on your actor make sure to have the "feather" symbol on the header sheet. *The weight is not calculated anymore and remain frozen (unless the setting 'Use standard calculation weight of the dnd5e system' is set to true in that case the weight calculation rollback to the standard weight calculation of the system dnd5e)* |

**NOTE: from 0.6.11 the button are colored !!!**

### Fake the metric system calculation, but we using the imperial one

This feature is enabled with the module setitng _'Fake the metric system calculation, but we using the imperial one'_

**Use this only with the system setting 'Use Metric Weight Units' checked.** because that setting doesn't update the value in lbs. to kg. of the item so the calculation is 'visually wrong', with this setting set to true we use the same imperial encumbrance costants, and avoid the problem, but this is a patch not a solution, this is why there it was this module in the past https://github.com/HadaIonut/Foundry-mgl

The calculation should be correct, the metric values ​​2.5, 5, 7.5 are the official ones of the dnd5e system, the problem is that checking the metric system checkbox does not consequently update the item values ​​as we would expect _1lb = 0.45kg_ but remains _1lb = 1kg_ therefore an object that weighs 6lb will result in weighing 6kg and this gives the illusion of displacing the weight, the description clearly says so **Replaces all reference to lbs with kgs and updates the encumbrance calculations to use metric weight units.** where with reference we mean the label 'lbs' in 'kg' not the value .... this is done on purpose to avoid a massive update of the items, consequently it does not update the weight on the objects, you can also check with the module deactivated. However, I attach an image for clarity.

### Integration with System Bulk based on the rules from [Giffyglyph](https://www.giffyglyph.com/darkerdungeons/grimoire/4.0.0/en/active_inventory.html)

An active inventory manages items using inventory slots (storage capacity) and object bulk (carrying effort).

### Inventory slots

Inventory slots describe storage capacity—how much can a thing carry without being overwhelmed? One slot holds one small object—a potion bottle, a dagger, a loaf of bread, etc.

Anything that can hold, carry, or contain objects can make use of inventory slots—for example:

- Creatures use slots to describe how much they can carry before they're encumbered.
- Containers use slots to describe how much they can store before they're full.
- Buildings use slots to describe how much free space they have in their rooms.
- Vehicles use slots to describe how much they can transport before they can't move.

### Your Inventory

Your inventory capacity depends on your creature size and strength modifier—the bigger and stronger you are, the more inventory slots you have.

As your size increases, so too does your bulk—a larger creature takes more effort to carry. Your bulk equals the larger of either a) your minimum bulk or b) the total bulk of everything in your inventory.

**Creature Inventory**

| Creature Size | Inventory Slots | Minimum Bulk |
|:-------------:|:---------------:|:------------:|
| Tiny | 6 + STR | 5 |
| Small | 14 + STR | 10 |
| Medium | 18 + STR | 20 |
| Large | 22 + [ STR x 2 ] | 40 |
| Huge | 30 + [ STR x 4 ] | 80 |
| Gargantuan | 46 + [ STR x 8 ] | 160 |

Here we see three characters calculate their inventory:

- Valiant, a human cleric, is a medium-sized creature (18 slots) with +2 STR (+2 slots). He has a total of 20 inventory slots, and occupies a minimum of 20 slots when carried.
- Crackle, a kobold wizard, is a small creature (14 slots) with −1 STR (−1 slot). She has 13 inventory slots and occupies a minimum of 10 slots.
- Brakken, a goliath barbarian, is a medium-sized creature with _Powerful Build_ (22 slots) and +3 STR (+6 slots). She has 28 inventory slots and occupies a minimum of 20 slots when carried.

#### More details about the calculation can be found [here](https://www.giffyglyph.com/darkerdungeons/grimoire/4.0.0/en/active_inventory.html)

### Bulk

Objects use bulk to describe how many inventory slots they fill—the bulkier the object, the more slots occupied.

Bulk represents the effort needed by a medium-sized creature to carry an object based on its size, weight, and shape—the more awkward or uncomfortable it is to hold an object, the higher its bulk.

#### Automatic suggested bulk

By default when the Bulk feature is enabled a little label "Suggested Bulk" show up on the item sheet preview for give a suggestion for the convertion lb/g to bulk based on the below _giffyglyph_ table:

| Category | Bulk	| Size | Weight |
|:-------------:|:---------------:|:------------:|:------------:|
| Tiny |0.2	| Tiny: Smaller than the palm of your hand. You can hold many of these in one hand. | Negligible: A negligible or trivial weight. |
| Small | 1	| Short: Up to a handspan / 9 inches. Can be held comfortably with one hand. | Light: Up to 2 lbs. The weight of a loaf of bread or a bag of sugar. |
| Medium | 2 | Medium: Up to an arms-length / 2 feet long. Can be held with one hand. | Medium: Up to 5 lbs. About as heavy as a few big bags of sugar. |
| Large | 3 | Long: Longer than an arm. Usually can be held with one hand, but us most comfortable with two. | Heavy: Up to 10 lbs. About as heavy as a cat or a sack of potatoes.|
| X-Large | 6 | Extra-long: Longer than the height of an average person. Requires two hands to hold. | Extra-heavy: Up to 35 lbs. About a quarter of the weight of an average person. |
| XX-Large | 9 | Extensive: Longer than the height of two people. Requires two hands to hold. | Leaden: Up to 70 lbs. About half as heavy as an average person. |


### Buttons header sheet for enable/disable the features of Bulk (Weight Bulk Calculation and Active Effects Bulk) actor by actor

Add new buttons on the header sheet of the actors for choose when to avoid to add the Active Effect or weight calculation. To much bad feed back on the automatization of the AE, i hope  with this to help the community to find the best solution for the single individual

| Symbol Button Header Sheet  | Description  |
|:----:|:----:|
|![bold-solid](./wiki/icons/bold-solid.svg) | If you want to have the Varian Encumbrance Active Effects and Weight calculation features on your actor make sure to have the "bold" symbol on the header sheet (this is the default) |
|![balance-scale-left-solid](./wiki/icons/balance-scale-left-solid.svg)| If you don't  want to have the Varian Encumbrance Active Effects feature on your actor make sure to have the "balance" symbol on the header sheet. ATTENTION the weight calculation feature is still active|
|![feather-alt-solid](./wiki/icons/feather-alt-solid.svg)| If you don't  want to have the Variant Encumbrance Active Effects and Weight calculation features on your actor make sure to have the "feather" symbol on the header sheet. *The weight is not calculated anymore and remain frozen (unless the setting 'Use standard calculation weight of the dnd5e system' is set to true in that case the weight calculation rollback to the standard weight calculation of the system dnd5e)* |

### Homebrew rules from the community !!!

**Feature: Do Not increase weight by quantity for no ammunition item:** This is a homebrew rule, for non-ammunition items don't increase weight by quantity (so 5 potions = 1 item weight for example

**Feature: Equipped Armor Weight Multiplier:** This is a homebrew rule, for equipped Armor types, if the weight is set to -1 is not applied, this will override the setting from _'Equipped Item Weight Multiplier'_. **NOTE:** The specific armor calculation setting _'Feature: Equipped Armor Weight Multiplier for 'XXX Armor'_ will be override this setting ONLY IF THE VALUE IS EQUAL TO 0.

**Feature: Equipped Armor Weight Multiplier for 'Clothing Armor':** This is a homebrew rule, and is mostly an upgrade of the existing feature _'Equipped Item Weight Multiplier'_ for equipped armor types **'clothing'**, a specific multiplier is applied to the weight value. **NOTE:** This setting is working only with the feature from _'Feature: Equipped Armor Weight Multiplier'_ IS EQUAL TO 0, the value by default the value is 0.

**Feature: Equipped Armor Weight Multiplier for 'Light Armor':** This is a homebrew rule, and is mostly an upgrade of the existing feature _'Equipped Item Weight Multiplier'_ for equipped armor types **'light'**, a specific multiplier is applied to the weight value. **NOTE:** This setting is working only with the feature from _'Feature: Equipped Armor Weight Multiplier'_ IS EQUAL TO 0, the value by default the value is 0.

**Feature: Equipped Armor Weight Multiplier for 'Medium Armor':** This is a homebrew rule, and is mostly an upgrade of the existing feature _'Equipped Item Weight Multiplier'_ for equipped armor types **'medium'**, a specific multiplier is applied to the weight value. **NOTE:** This setting is working only with the feature from _'Feature: Equipped Armor Weight Multiplier'_ IS EQUAL TO 0, the value by default the value is 0.

**Feature: Equipped Armor Weight Multiplier for 'Heavy Armor':** This is a homebrew rule, and is mostly an upgrade of the existing feature _'Equipped Item Weight Multiplier'_ for equipped armor types **'heavy'**, a specific multiplier is applied to the weight value. **NOTE:** This setting is working only with the feature from _'Feature: Equipped Armor Weight Multiplier'_ IS EQUAL TO 0, the value by default the value is 0.

**Feature: Equipped Armor Weight Multiplier for 'Natural Armor':** This is a homebrew rule, and is mostly an upgrade of the existing feature _'Equipped Item Weight Multiplier'_ for equipped armor types **'natural'**, a specific multiplier is applied to the weight value. **NOTE:** This setting is working only with the feature from _'Feature: Equipped Armor Weight Multiplier'_ IS EQUAL TO 0, the value by default the value is 0.

**Feature: Equipped Container/Backpack Weight Multiplier:** This is a homebrew rule, for equipped container/backpack types, if the weight is set to -1 is not applied, this will override the setting from 'Equipped Item Weight Multiplier'.

**Feature: Use STR flat value instead STR MOD on Bulk:** This is a homebrew rule, ONLY FOR BULK calculation. Currently there is no way to adjust the maximum bulk for a creature, which is tied to size and STR MOD, now you can use the flat value of force to handle it.

### Variant Encumbrance Flag

Should you wish to integrate some of Variant Encumbrance's calculations into your own modules, there is now a flag which stores the actor's encumbrance tier, weight, and modified speed. Encumbrance tier is presented as 0, 1, 2, 3, as Unencumbered, Encumbered, Heavily Encumbered, Over Encumbered, respectively.

|Encumbered Speed Decrease| The number of speed units subtracted when heavily encumbered, default is 20.|20||
|Encumbered Speed Decrease (Metric System)| The number of speed units subtracted when heavily encumbered, default is 6.|6||
|Enable pre check encumbrance tier| I DON'T RECOMMENDED it, but does anyone seem to use this strange rule? If true the add/remove of the AE is launched only when there is a change on the value level of the tier so the refresh is ignored when add/remove/update item|false||
|Enable/Disable the feature for applying the variant encumbrance active effects for specific actor| If true add on the header sheet of the actor a button visible only to GM for enable/disable the active effects feature, by default the feature is disabled (the flag is false) for performance issues|true||
|Remove label from buttons on the header character sheet| Remove label from buttons on the header character sheet, Useful for little screen and mobile, by default is true|true||
|Use standard calculation weight of the dnd5e system| I DON'T RECOMMENDED it, but some people seem to lose their mind for 2s instead of 1s on the calculation weight ???, you will lose all the benefit from the others feature like Equipped, Unequipped, Proficient Equipped, Inventory +, Item container, ecc., but hey !! you got the 1 sec you miss.|false||
|Use equipped/unequipped feature of the ItemCollection/Item Container module for the backpack| I DON'T RECOMMENDED it, the only difference (only for item container) is \"Item container\" module set 0 if unequipped, the \"variant encumbrance\" get the value from the module setting by default 1 if unequipped, and now i remember the calculation not make sense for some people because there are two behaviour for the equipped and unequipped items if they are item container or standard item. Bags can be unequipped by players or GM, so that their reported weight drops to 0 in your inventory (only bags with a capacity other than 0 can be unequipped)|false|This make sense only with [Item Collection/Item Containers](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/itemcollection) installed and active|
|Enable DAE integration|If enabled, this setting will apply the value recovered by the DAE effects to the 'system.attributes.encumbrance.max' and 'system.attributes.capacity.cargo' attributes IF the 'DAE' module is present and active.|true||

|Weight Units (Bulk System)|Units displayed in the encumbrance bar (just graphics) (Bulk System). Default is 'bulk'|bulk||
|Encumbered Speed Decrease (Bulk System)|The number of speed units multiply when heavily encumbered (Bulk System), default is '0.5'.|0.5||
|Automatic apply suggested bulk|WARNING: THIS IS DANGEROUS, IT WILL UPDATE THE BULK DATA ON EVERY ITEM BEEN RENDERED IF THE BULK VALUE IS 0. This is usually save time if you don't want to manually set every item (the advisable way)|false||
|Currency Per Bulk Unit (Bulk System)|This parameter allows for the weight of coins to be taken into account in the Bulk system. If you do not like it you can disable it by setting it to 0, the default value provided is 100, so the calculation formula will be 'number of coins / 100' for example 'Krazak finds a rotting chest that holds 1,900 assorted copper coins (19 bulk carried)'|100||
|Remove standard encumbrance bar from the character sheet| If enabled it will hide the standard bar of encumbrance, is useful only for people using the bulk bar and do not want to see two graphic bars|false|
|Feature: Do Not increase weight by quantity for no ammunition item| This is a homebrew rule, for non-ammunition items don't increase weight by quantity (so 5 potions = 1 item weight for example). ATTENTION: If the module 'Variant Encumbrance' is present and active this feature is disabled by default if the module settings 'Feature: Integration with Variant Encumbrance' is enabled.|false||
|Feature: Equipped Armor Weight Multiplier|This is a homebrew rule, for equipped Armor types, if the weight is set to -1 is not applied, this will override the setting from _'Equipped Item Weight Multiplier'_. **NOTE:** The specific armor calculation setting _'Feature: Equipped Armor Weight Multiplier for 'XXX Armor'_ will be override this setting ONLY IF THE VALUE IS EQUAL TO 0.|-1||
